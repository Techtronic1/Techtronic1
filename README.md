# **George Zambrana**
## I teach Computer Science at **Steinmetz College Prep**🏫
First tech I ever owned that was offically was an HP Pavillion desktop🖥️ in 2003<br>
I constantly upgraded it especially with a tv turner, video card and a external zip drive<br>
I also upgrade my ram for the first time.<br>

My hometown is Chicago🏢 even though I wasn't born there<br>
Email me : gzambrana@cps.edu
I love art of all forms, whether its music, painting, scuplture, design, comics, the list can go on (I am pretty much obsessed).
